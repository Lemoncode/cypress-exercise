# Cypress Exercise

We want to add end to end tests for our solution. To achieve this we decide to use __cypress__. Our application is pretty simple by now it just add cards with a simple form.

1. Add cypress to project.
2. Create a test that tests our main functionality,  add new cards to kind reminder.
